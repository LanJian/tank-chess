# Tank Chess

https://lanjian.github.io/tank-chess/

Two players play against each other to try to destroy the opponent's tanks.

* During the command phase, players issue commands to their tanks.
* In the execution phase, the tanks execute the commands simultaneously.
* The tanks have armor(blue cubes), a turret(yellow cube), and an engine(red cube).
* If the engine is destroyed, the tank cannot move; If the turret is destroyed, the tank cannot shoot.
* The first player to completely destroy the opponent's tanks wins.
